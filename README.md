# Investment-analysis

This project is devoted to performing different financial investment analysis. 

**Fama-French five-factor regression.** The code performs the Fama-French five-factor regression for monthly returns for two US equity mutual funds from the CRSP.

**Relation between ESG risk and future stock return.** Adopting RepRisk Index (RRI) as the proxy for ESG risk, the code tests the relation between ESG risk and future 1-month stock return with control variables.

**Textual analysis and machine learning.** The code does the following: calculates the cosine similarity score between financial quarterly reports, tests the tone of quarterly reports using negative word list, draws word clouds of quarterly reports.


*The Fama-French Five-factor Model is built based on 5 factors: Market excess return, Size (or SMB - Small minus Big), Value (or HML - High minus Low), Profitability (or RMW - Robust minus Weak), and Investment (or CMA - Conservative minus Aggressive).
